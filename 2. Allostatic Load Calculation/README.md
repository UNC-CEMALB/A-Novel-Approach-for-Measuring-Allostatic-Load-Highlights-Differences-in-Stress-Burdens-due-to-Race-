# Allostatic Load Calculation (Table S1, Figures 1-3)
- Calculated allostatic load (AL) scores for each subject which serves as a measure of stress (combines acute and chronic stress)
- t tests were run to test for statistical difference in acute stres, chronic stress, and AL across race, sex, and smoking status groups
- ANOVA and post hoc t tests were run to test for differences in subjects further stratified within those demographic groups
